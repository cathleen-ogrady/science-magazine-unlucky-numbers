# Unlucky numbers: Toy examples of investigative bias

In ["Unlucky Numbers"](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7536) (*Science*, 20 January 2023), an infographic (p. 231) demonstrates the effect of investigative bias in a case of suspected serial murder. By slightly changing how many deaths are attributed to a nurse under suspicion, biases could have a drastic effect on how suspicious a sequence of deaths appears to be. This script shows how the probabilities in the infographic were calculated. 

Method adapted from the the 2022 Royal Statistical Society report ["Healthcare serial killer or coincidence? Statistical issues in investigation of suspected medical misconduct."](https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/news-publications/2022/section-group-reports/rss-publishes-report-on-dealing-with-uncertainty-i/)
